<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m a bioengineer and translational researcher driven by one purpose: to bridge scientific discovery with human impact. My passion lies where imaging, cell biology, and engineering meet to create breakthroughs in diagnostics and therapeutics. But my motivation isn’t just scientific—it’s deeply personal. Witnessing loved ones battle chronic illnesses rooted my career in a mission that goes beyond the lab bench.</p>
<p>At UC San Diego’s Kravets Lab, I lead thesis research on calcium signaling and beta-cell network dynamics in Type 2 Diabetes. Leveraging confocal microscopy, FLIM, and live-cell imaging, I map how intra-islet communication influences insulin secretion—advancing early biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting.</p>
<p>Previously, in the Cheresh Lab, I explored pancreatic cancer's tumor-stromal interactions and the signaling mechanics of cancer-associated fibroblasts. That work gave me not only a toolkit of preclinical and imaging techniques, but also a firsthand view into translational research with urgency.</p>
<p>What makes me unique is my ability to speak both languages: rigorous experimental science and scalable, product-driven strategy. At Krishagni Solutions, I deployed research informatics platforms for institutions across three continents—aligning clinical workflows, biospecimen automation, and compliance with international standards.</p>
<p>Whether I’m decoding beta-cell responses, building automated pipelines, or enabling research through intuitive systems—I thrive in collaborative, mission-driven environments where precision meets purpose.</p>
<p>I’m currently exploring Associate Scientist or Scientist I/II roles in biotech, medtech, or pharma—particularly where translational research, imaging, and next-gen therapies intersect. If your work changes lives, I’d love to contribute to it.</p>
